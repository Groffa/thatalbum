# PURPOSE

To produce a full length album (8 tracks) using only software I develop in this
repository.

This will include:
+ Synthesizer
+ Drum machine (connected to the above?)
+ Some sort of tracker or what you may call it

# LIMITATIONS

+ No external libraries (only OS-dependent things for sound output)
+ Pure C

# WHY

For fun.

# MUSIC GENRE

It will not be chip tunes. These tracks will share the same identity as my other Yellow Bear-songs
